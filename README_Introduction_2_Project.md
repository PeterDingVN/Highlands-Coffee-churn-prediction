# Highland Coffee churn prediction
This project aims at helping Highlands Coffee to predict potential churns among customers in order to better focus their resources on loyal customers.
As part of the project, I first had to segment the customers and used this information of segmentation to predict churns.
The result in training process looked quite promising:
- Predicting accurately churns versus retained about 87% of the time, outperforming blind guessing every customer as retained.
- The model could identify churns correctly about 77% of the time.
- It could also cover about 63% cases of churns.

# Note
The data for training is made-up and not parts of private information of Highlands Coffee. And this project serves educational purpose rather than commercial one.
Any contribution or suggestions for improvement is strongly appreciated.
